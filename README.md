# Flights
Flights is a flight schedule visualizer to be used as a learning tool for beginner programmers.
It will be written in Python and simply print a flight schedule to the console.

Flight data will be read in from a `.txt` file and then displayed in a nicely formatted table that adapts to the given data.

## Data format
The flight data is stored in a comma- and line-delimited `.txt` file like so:

airline, flight number, arrival time, departure time, ticket price

## Flights program
The flights program should run in the terminal and display the flight data in a neatly formatted table with headers for each column. The program should also offer the user a basic menu where they can choose the order in which to sort the flight information. At least three different options should be given for sorting the data.

The program should continue running until the user chooses to quit it.
